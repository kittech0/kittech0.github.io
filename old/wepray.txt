O Holy Trinity, we, who bear many names yet share one name—Imago Dei—come before You and ask, why have You not forsaken us? We, who ate of the apple of knowledge, we, who have turned against You time and again?

O Holy Son of the Most High, why did You die for us? What good have we done? We, the most corrupt of all creation? Why have You prepared a place for us in the heavens?

O Holy Spirit, why have You granted us faith? Why have You baptized us in Your love and grace? We are not worthy. Why, O Father, did You give Your only Son? We, who have caused You so much pain, who have forsaken You, are undeserving of such grace.

Yet still, You love us so much that You died for us. O Son of Man, the most perfect Lamb of God, You became like us, dying on the cross as many pagans do, and yet, You bore the sins of all. You did this so that we may dwell with You for eternity.

You are the way, the truth, the life, and we rejoice in You, O Holy Trinity. Born of the Blessed Virgin Mary, You took on our corrupt flesh and made it clean. You bore our pain, our agony, and in dying, You conquered death itself.

Let all creation confess, You are the Lamb of God, the One who blesses us eternally.
